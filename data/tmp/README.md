# Directory purpose

The directory is used to store temporal data files with assets prices that cannot be included in the repository due to copyright.

The script "assetsPricePlanetAspects.R" retrieves "watchlist.csv" assets symbols prices from Yahoo Finance and merges with daily planet aspects table and stores the resulting table in this directory.
